                    <h2>What is a DOT physical and why do you need it?</h2>
                    <p>A Department of Transportation (DOT) physical is a physical exam that is required if someone is driving a commercial vehicle. A DOT physical follows strict guidelines mandated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), ensuring that commercial drivers and other safety-sensitive employees are in good health to work safely.</p>

                    <h2>About our primary care services</h2>
                    <p>With Nao Medical's primary care, you can either walk in or make an appointment ahead of time. You can visit our urgent care or walk-in medical clinics near you during operating hours. We're open seven days a week and closed only if NYS declares an emergency.</p>

                    <div class="alert">
                        <h3>Before booking your appointment please note:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ensure that your insurance benefits include urgent care or contact us to confirm if your individual/group insurance plan is eligible for use.</li>

                            <p>During a DOT physical, the doctor will check your vision, hearing, blood pressure, and overall physicality. They will also take a urine sample to check for medical issues that may prevent you from driving safely.</p>

                            <p>Before going to your exam, make sure to bring your driver's license, list of medications you are taking, medical history, contact lenses or prescription glasses you use, or hearing aids, if you use them.</p>

                            <p>A DOT physical exam is good for two years. If you have medical conditions, you may be asked to get a DOT physical more often.</p>

                            <p>Yes. You can wear contact lenses or hearing aids during the DOT physical so the doctor can also check if your glasses, contacts, and hearing aid need to be updated.</p>

                            <p>At Nao Medical, we accept most major insurance plans, but in order to know if your plan covers the test, we would need to run your insurance and this can only be done at the beginning of your visit. If you would like to know ahead of time, please call the number on the back of your insurance card so a representative may let you know which coronavirus test is covered by your insurance plan.</p>
